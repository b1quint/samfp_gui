# SAM-FP: Graphical User Interface

This package contains a graphical interface written using PyQt and Python
to control the SAM-FP mode at the SOAR telescope. Be aware that it will only
work if you are somehow inside SOAR's network since it uses TCP/IP to communicate
with the FP Plugin for SAMI, the SAM Imager. Please, follow up
the instructions bellow to download and install your software.

Also, if the FP Plugin is not running on the SAMI's machine, this
program will not do anything actually. So you may want to connect
to it via VNC and make sure it is running properly.
